fov - field of view is the angle of the cameraâ€™s lens. Imagine a camera on a tripod, if you change lens to wide angle you get a higher fov. Try to imagine a cone coming out from the camera, it can only see objects in that area.
aspect - ratio parameter is the width divided by the height of the canvas window. 
The near and far distances are any positive numbers you wish to select, with the restriction that near is always less than far. The distance between near and far should be kept as small as possible to reduce precision issues since the frustum is being mapped into a clipping volume that is 2 units deep. Typical values for near and far might be 0.1 to 100.0. In general, make near as far away from the camera as possible and make far as close to the camera as possible.
